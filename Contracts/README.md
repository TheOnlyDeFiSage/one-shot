# V4 Project Overview 🚀

## Introduction

The V4 project represents a significant evolution of our Ethereum-based betting game, building upon the solid foundations of previous versions. This iteration introduces enhanced player tracking, bet history recording, and a more sophisticated reward system. The key contracts continue to be `GameWithJackpot` and `BalanceTracker`, now with expanded capabilities.

## Story Behind the Project 📖

Our journey began with an engaging X conversation with Daniel Marini, CEO of Nexus Labs, who proposed a fun idea for a "1-button test casino." The concept was simple: a single button with a 50% chance of doubling your NEX points or losing them. Building on this, we've expanded the idea into a dynamic gaming ecosystem, evolving through multiple versions to enhance the player experience!
